### $IV$
If the $\mathbb{Cov}(\mathbb{e}_i, x_{ji})$ assumption is violated for OLS. We may be able to avoid bias / identify parameter using $IV$ and 2SLS. 

***For $IV$ to work:***
1. $IV$ needs to be correlated with $x$,
2. $IV$ needs to only affect $y$ via $x$
3. $IV$ cannot affect y and other way

### 2SLS (2-stage least sequence)
***1st stage:*** covariates are regressed against $IV$s to produce a set of fitted values of covariates
***2nd stage:*** the outcome variables is regressed against the fitted covariates

### 2SLS Estimates Operates
$y_i = \beta x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + ... + \beta_jx_{ji} + error_i$
$\mathbb{Cov}(error_i, x_{ji}) ≠ 0$

$IV$: $z_{1i}, z_{2i}$ $for$ $x_{2i}$

$Estimate$ $x_{2i} = \gamma_{0}+ \gamma_1z_{1i} + \gamma_2z_{2i}+ error_i$

To produce fit  $\hat{x}_{2i} = \hat{\gamma}_{0}+ \hat{\gamma}_1z_{1i} + \hat{\gamma}_2z_{2i}$

$\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}x_{1i} + \hat{\beta_2}x_{2i}$ $or$ $fitted$ $y_i$

${\hat{\beta_{0},}\hat{\beta_{1},}\hat{\beta_2}}$ are 2SLS estimates

### Using multi-instruments
In practice, we often identify one or a couple strong instruments and for the remaining $z_s$, we use the other covariates. eg.
2nd stage: $birthweight$ ~ $\hat{cigs} + motheduc$
1st stage: $cigs$ ~ $cigtax + motheduc$

$birthweight = \beta_0 + \underbrace{ \beta_1cigs + \beta_2motheduc + e_i}_{cov≠0}$
