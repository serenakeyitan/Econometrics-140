### Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)

In the case of non-compliance, LATE is the ATE on compliers

***Compliers*** \begin{cases}
  \text{if assigned treatment, they take treatment}\\    
  \text{if NOT assigned treatment, they do NOT take treatment}\\    
\end{cases}

***Non-Compliers*** \begin{cases}
  \text{A. always takers: receive treatment whether assigned treatment}\\    
  \text{B. never takers: never take treatment even if assigned}\\    
  \text{C. defilers(ignored): always do the opposite of what they are assigned}\\    
\end{cases}

***With Non Compliance, even if we have RCT:***

$z_i$ denotes assignment status

\begin{cases}
  z_i = 1 & \text{if assigned}\\    
  z_i = 0 & \text{if NOT assigned}\\    
\end{cases}


$D_i$ denotes treatment status
\begin{cases}
  D_i = 1 & \text{if assigned}\\    
  D_i = 0 & \text{if NOT assigned}\\    
\end{cases}

#### Solution (one of them) is to use IV
- in RCT, use assignment status as IV to estimate LATE
- In one sided noncompliance, $z_i$ is exogenous, and correlated with outcome through its influence on compliers, and affects outcome through $D_i$

*fitted $\hat{D_i}$ is no longer a binary/dummy variable

#### In the context of RD, use an IV for $D_i$ such that 
$$
y = \beta_0+ \beta_1\hat{D_i} + \beta_2x_i + \epsilon$$
$$
y = \beta_0+ \beta_1\hat{D_i} + \beta_2x_i + \beta_3\hat{D_i}x_i+\epsilon$$

This is a type of ***fuzzy RD*** design

### Difference between Sharp RDD and Fuzzy RDD
- Sharp RDD: Assignment or running variable completely determines treatment. A jump in the probability of treatment before and after cutoff point. 
- Fuzzy RDD: Cutoff point increases the probability of treatment but doesn't completeley determines treatment.

For treatment group: $△treat = B - A$

Effect of treatment: $DID = △treat - △comp$
